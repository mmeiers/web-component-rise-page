# Rise Page Web Component

## Introduction

## Usage
To use the Rise Page Web Component, you should first install `webcomponents.js`. The `webcomponents.js` polyfills enable Web Components in (evergreen) browsers that lack native support.

To install with Bower:
```
bower install webcomponentsjs
```

To install with npm:
```
npm install webcomponents.js
```

Next, install the Rise Page Web Component with Bower:
```
bower install https://github.com/Rise-Vision/web-component-rise-page.git
```

Finally, construct your HTML page. You should include `webcomponents.js` before any code that touches the DOM, and load the Web Component using an HTML Import.

## Development

### Dependencies
* [Git](http://git-scm.com/) - Git is a free and open source distributed version control system that is used to manage our source code on Github.
* [npm](https://www.npmjs.org/) & [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/) - npm is the default package manager for Node.js. npm runs through the command line and manages dependencies for an application. These dependencies are listed in the _package.json_ file.
* [Bower](http://bower.io/) - Bower is a package manager for Javascript libraries and frameworks. All third-party Javascript dependencies are listed in the _bower.json_ file.
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) - Gulp is a Javascript task runner. It lints, runs unit and E2E (end-to-end) tests, minimizes files, etc. Gulp tasks are defined in _gulpfile.js_.

### Local Development Environment Setup and Installation
To make changes to the Web Component, you'll first need to install the dependencies:

- [Git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)
- [Node.js and npm](http://blog.nodeknockout.com/post/65463770933/how-to-install-node-js-and-npm)
- [Bower](http://bower.io/#install-bower) - To install Bower, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g bower`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g bower`.
- [Gulp](https://github.com/gulpjs/gulp/blob/master/docs/getting-started.md) - To install Gulp, run the following command in Terminal: `npm install -g gulp`. Should you encounter any errors, try running the following command instead: `sudo npm install -g gulp`.

The Web Components can now be installed by executing the following commands in Terminal:
```
git clone https://github.com/Rise-Vision/web-component-rise-page.git
cd web-component-rise-page
npm install
bower install
```

### Run Locally
You can access the `demo.html` file via a local web server. On Mac, execute the following command from the root directory of the Web Component:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

This starts a web server on port 8000, and you can access the Rise Page Web Component by navigating to `localhost:8000/demo.html`.

### Testing
You can run the suite of tests via a local web server. On Mac, execute the following command from the root directory of the Web Component:
```
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

This starts a web server on port 8000, and you can run the tests by navigating to `http://localhost:8000/test/index.html`.

### Deployment
Once you are satisifed with your changes, deploy the `components` and `rise-page` folders to your server. You can then use the Web Component by following the *Usage* instructions.
